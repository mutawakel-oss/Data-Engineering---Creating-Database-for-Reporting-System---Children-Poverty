# Data-Engineering---Creating-Database-for-Reporting-System---Children-Poverty
I have worked as a Data Engineer for this project.

The purpose of this project is to create an efficient and secure database for a reporting system aims to study the poverty of children in 4 countries (India, Ethiopia, Peru, Vietnam).

The tools used are (MS SQL Server & Microsoft Power BI) and the scripting used langugages is T-SQL.

Following database objects were created as part of this project:
1- Tables
2- Views
3- Stored Procedures
4- Triggers
5- User Defined Functions
5- Check Constraints
6- Security Roles and Permissions
7- Power BI Charts
8- Power BI Dashboards

#	Abstract
Reporting systems helps to analyse data stored in databases and capture many data insights that helps to take mature decisions and improve businesses. Therefore, task 1 aims to design, implement, and test a database system for a reporting system which targets to measure the child poverty in four countries (India, Ethiopia, Peru, Vietnam). Original datasets were imported from UK Data Services portal into MS SQL Server to create a new database for the reporting system and 8 Check Constraints were created for each one of the countries`s 4 tables to validate entered data for the selected critical attributes. A Custom Table was created to log any changes in the critical attributes along with 4 Database Triggers to automatically log these changes. Moreover, 17 Database Views were created to study children poverty in these four countries. Additionally, 17 Stored Procedures and 1 User Defined Function was created to provide a search facility for the users on the reporting system database. Although task 1 does not require any data visualization, 9 Power BI Charts were created to gain more marks as part of the BI techniques of Task 1 and 3 Power BI Dashboard were created to summarize the 9 charts. As a result, the created database objects and BI charts have helped to identify the top countries in several areas such as (wealth index and services accessibility, children who smoke or drink alcohol, good health rate, attending pre-primary school, good children time management).
